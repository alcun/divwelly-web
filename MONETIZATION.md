## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Server costs scaling:** Start with cheap VPS, move to cloud if needed
- **Database performance:** Index properly, cache aggressively
- **Payment processing:** Use Stripe (handles compliance)

### Business Risks
- **Low conversion to paid:** Validate willingness to pay early
- **Competitor copies features:** Move fast, build brand loyalty
- **Market too small:** Dual market (consumers + landlords) diversifies risk

### Legal Risks
- **Data protection (GDPR):** Encrypt data, allow exports/deletions
- **Payment disputes:** Terms of service, no liability for tenant/landlord disputes
- **Receipts as legal proof:** Disclaimer that app is for tracking only

**Problem is real:** Everyone who's lived in a flat has this problem
**Solution is simple:** Not trying to do everything, just expense splitting done right
**Timing is right:** Remote work = more people in shared housing
**Market is underserved:** Splitwise hasn't innovated in years
**We have distribution:** App stores, social media, word of mouth
**We can execute:** Full-stack dev, design, marketing knowledge

2. ✅ Get our household using it for 2-4 weeks
3. ✅ Build React Native app
4. ✅ Soft launch to 10 friend households
5. ✅ Submit to App Store + Google Play
6. Then worry about monetization

**Goal:** Make it so good we'd pay for it ourselves. If we would, others will too.
