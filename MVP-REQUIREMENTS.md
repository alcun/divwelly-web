# Divwelly MVP Requirements

## Real-World Use Case (Your Household)

**Goal:** Get housemates to sign in, see what they owe, mark as paid, upload proof of payment.

### Current Expenses
- **Rent:** ¬£895/month split 3 ways = ¬£298.33/person (6th of each month, started June 6th, 12 months)
- **Internet:** Fixed amount, same day each month
- **Electricity:** Variable, start of each month
- **Council Tax:** ¬£165/month split 3 ways = ¬£55/person (start of each month)

---

## MVP Feature Priorities (In Order)

### üî¥ Critical - Must Have Before Launch

#### 1. Recurring Expenses ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Problem:** Have to manually add rent/internet/council tax every month
**Solution:**
- Add "Recurring" toggle when creating expense
- Set frequency: Monthly, Weekly, Yearly
- Set start date (e.g., 6th of month for rent)
- Set end date or "ongoing"
- System auto-creates expense on due date
- Show upcoming recurring expenses

**Backend:**
- New table: `recurring_expenses`
- Cron job or scheduled task to create expenses
- New endpoints: CRUD for recurring expenses

**Frontend:**
- Recurring expense setup form
- List of recurring expenses
- Edit/delete recurring expenses

---

#### 2. Individual Payment Tracking ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Problem:** Can't see who has/hasn't paid for each expense
**Solution:**
- Each expense shows 3 columns: Person | Amount Owed | Status (Paid/Unpaid)
- Members can mark their portion as "Paid"
- Upload screenshot/receipt when marking paid
- Admin sees who has/hasn't paid at a glance

**Backend:**
- New table: `expense_payments` (expense_id, user_id, amount, paid_at, receipt_url)
- New endpoint: `POST /api/expenses/:id/payments` (mark as paid + upload receipt)
- Update balances to reflect paid expenses
- File upload handling (S3 or local storage)

**Frontend:**
- Payment status table on each expense
- "Mark as Paid" button for each member
- Image upload for receipt
- Visual indicators (‚úì paid, ‚úó unpaid)

---

#### 3. Leave/Remove Members ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Problem:** Members can't leave, admins can't remove people
**Solution:**
- "Leave Household" button for members
- "Remove Member" button for admins (on each member)
- Confirmation dialogs
- Check for unpaid balances before leaving (warning)

**Backend:**
- New endpoint: `POST /api/households/:id/leave`
- New endpoint: `DELETE /api/households/:id/members/:memberId` (admin only)
- Update `householdMembers.isActive` instead of deleting (keep history)
- Recalculate balances after removal

**Frontend:**
- Leave button in settings/profile
- Remove button next to each member (admin only)
- Confirmation modals

---

### üü° Important - Nice to Have

#### 4. Edit/Delete Expenses ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Problem:** Can't fix mistakes
**Solution:**
- Edit expense (description, amount, date)
- Delete expense (with confirmation)
- Only creator or admin can edit/delete
- Recalculate balances after changes

---

#### 5. Expense Categories ‚≠ê
**Problem:** Can't organize expenses
**Solution:**
- Fixed categories: Rent, Utilities, Groceries, Bills, Other
- Color-coded badges
- Filter expenses by category
- Monthly summary by category

---

#### 6. Date Filtering ‚≠ê
**Problem:** Can't see monthly breakdown
**Solution:**
- Month selector (Jan 2025, Feb 2025, etc.)
- Show expenses for selected month
- Total spent for that month
- Outstanding payments for that month

---

### üü¢ Optional - Future

#### 7. Notifications
- Email when expense added
- Reminder when payment due
- Notification when someone marks as paid

#### 8. Settle Up
- Record direct payments between members
- "I paid John ¬£50"

---

## MVP Data Model Changes

### New Tables Needed

#### expense_payments
```sql
CREATE TABLE expense_payments (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  expense_id uuid REFERENCES expenses(id),
  user_id text REFERENCES user(id),
  amount integer NOT NULL, -- in pence
  paid_at timestamp,
  receipt_url text,
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### recurring_expenses
```sql
CREATE TABLE recurring_expenses (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  household_id uuid REFERENCES households(id),
  description text NOT NULL,
  amount integer NOT NULL,
  frequency text NOT NULL, -- 'monthly', 'weekly', 'yearly'
  start_date date NOT NULL,
  end_date date,
  day_of_month integer, -- for monthly (1-31)
  day_of_week integer, -- for weekly (0-6)
  created_by text REFERENCES user(id),
  is_active boolean DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

---

## Implementation Order (2-3 Weeks)

### Week 1: Individual Payment Tracking
**Why First:** Core to "see what you owe and mark as paid"
1. Create `expense_payments` table
2. Backend endpoints for marking paid + upload receipt
3. Frontend payment status UI
4. Receipt upload handling

### Week 2: Recurring Expenses
**Why Second:** Eliminate manual entry for rent/bills
1. Create `recurring_expenses` table
2. Admin UI to set up recurring expenses
3. Cron job to auto-create expenses
4. Edit/delete recurring expenses

### Week 3: Polish & Member Management
1. Leave/remove members
2. Edit/delete expenses
3. Categories & filtering
4. Testing with real housemates

---

## MVP Success Criteria

‚úÖ Housemates can sign in
‚úÖ See all expenses for the month
‚úÖ See exactly what they owe for each expense
‚úÖ Mark their portion as paid
‚úÖ Upload payment screenshot
‚úÖ Admins see payment status at a glance
‚úÖ Rent/bills auto-added each month
‚úÖ No manual data entry needed

---

## Questions to Answer

1. **File storage:** Where to store receipt images? (S3, Cloudinary, or local?)
2. **Recurring expense conflicts:** What if someone already added this month's rent manually?
3. **Payment verification:** Should admin approve payments or trust uploads?
4. **Partial payments:** Allow paying less than full amount?
5. **Payment methods:** Track how they paid (bank transfer, cash, etc.)?

---

## Next Steps

Ready to start building? I recommend:
1. ‚úÖ Start with **Individual Payment Tracking** (most critical)
2. ‚úÖ Then **Recurring Expenses** (eliminate manual work)
3. ‚úÖ Then **Leave/Remove Members** (basic hygiene)

Want to start on payment tracking? That's the foundation for everything else.
