## Technical Considerations

### Database Changes Needed
- New table: `settlements` (user_from, user_to, amount, date, household_id)
- New table: `activity_log` (or query existing tables)
- Add `category` to `expenses` table
- New table: `recurring_expenses` (if implemented)
- New table: `expense_splits` (if custom splits implemented)

### API Routes Needed
See individual features above for specific endpoints.

### Frontend State Management
- Consider adding more optimistic UI updates
- Add loading states for all actions
- Better error handling and recovery
- Consider React Query or similar for cache management

## Questions to Consider
1. **Which features are most important to you?**
2. **Do you want to tackle API work first or frontend first?**
3. **Should we add categories as a fixed list or allow custom categories?**
4. **For settlements - should we allow partial payments or full settlement only?**
5. **Should we track settlement history or just update balances?**

Let me know which features you want to prioritize and we'll start building!
