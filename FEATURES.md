## Recommended Next Steps (MVP Focus)

**See `MVP-REQUIREMENTS.md` for detailed real-world use case**
**See `MONETIZATION.md` for business strategy, pricing, and growth plans**

### Phase 1: Payment Tracking (Week 1) ‚≠ê CRITICAL
1. Individual payment tracking per expense
2. Mark as paid functionality
3. Upload payment receipt/screenshot
4. Payment status indicators

### Phase 2: Recurring Expenses (Week 2) ‚≠ê CRITICAL
1. Set up recurring expenses (rent, bills, etc.)
2. Auto-create expenses on schedule
3. Edit/delete recurring expenses
4. View upcoming recurring expenses

### Phase 3: Member Management (Week 3) ‚≠ê CRITICAL
1. Leave household functionality
2. Admin can remove/kick members
3. Edit/delete expenses
4. Expense categories

### Phase 4: Polish & Launch
1. Date filtering / monthly view
2. Better error handling
3. Loading states
4. Test with real housemates

### Phase 5: Advanced (Post-Launch)
1. Notifications (email/push)
2. Settle up (direct payments)
3. Export to CSV
4. Custom split amounts

---

## Technical Considerations

### Database Changes Needed
- New table: `settlements` (user_from, user_to, amount, date, household_id)
- New table: `activity_log` (or query existing tables)
- Add `category` to `expenses` table
- New table: `recurring_expenses` (if implemented)
- New table: `expense_splits` (if custom splits implemented)

### API Routes Needed
See individual features above for specific endpoints.

### Frontend State Management
- Consider adding more optimistic UI updates
- Add loading states for all actions
- Better error handling and recovery
- Consider React Query or similar for cache management

---

## Questions to Consider
1. **Which features are most important to you?**
2. **Do you want to tackle API work first or frontend first?**
3. **Should we add categories as a fixed list or allow custom categories?**
4. **For settlements - should we allow partial payments or full settlement only?**
5. **Should we track settlement history or just update balances?**

Let me know which features you want to prioritize and we'll start building!
